Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Upload all files in this folder (index.html, style.css, manifest.json, icon.png).
3. In repository settings -> Pages, set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch" and pick main branch root.
4. Visit https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/
5. Open the page on your phone, Add to Home Screen -> works like an app.
